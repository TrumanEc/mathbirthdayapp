MathBirthDays.com is a site that wants to help people celebrate their special "math birthdays." A  "math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math  birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you  are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc.  The mathbirthdays.com site is very simple. There is a way to select your birth date, and the  page shows your next upcoming math birthday.
